Basic Python programs 


Covering some of the basic Python programs

These are sample Python programs which helped me to explore more of Python while learning the language.
Most of the sample programs here are taken from the book, "Learning Python" by B.Nagesh Rao
(https://www.amazon.in/Learning-Python-Nagesh-Rao-ebook/dp/B08TZX93BK/ref=sr_1_1?crid=1XAVT3GXHMLOY&keywords=learning+python+B+nagesh+rao&qid=1704029111&s=digital-text&sprefix=learning+python+b+nagesh+rao%2Cdigital-text%2C217&sr=1-1)

The book covers in detail on the basic concepts. Very good for a novice programmer to start his programming journey and helps an experienced programmer to improve their coding skills.


More sample programs and examples to be added in this repository in the coming days..
